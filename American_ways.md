### Introduction
 *  Generalizations such as the ones in this book are subject to exception and refinement.
 *  The general characteristics of American culture have been ascribed by various observers to such factors as its temperate climate; its nineteenth-century history as a large country with an open frontier to the west; its citizens’ origins among dissenters and the lower classes in Europe; its high level of technological development; the influence of Christianity; the declining influence of Christianity; its capitalist economic system; and “God’s benevolent attention.”
 * “People act the way they were taught to act, and they all have different teachers.” There are reasons for the way people behave, even if we can’t be certain what those reasons are
 * It is usually helpful, when trying to understand others, to understand how we see ourselves.
 * Americans often say they have no culture, since they often conceive of culture as an overlay of arbitrary customs to be found only in other countries.
 * Like people everywhere else, Americans, as they grow up, are taught certain attitudes toward other countries and the people who live in them. Parents, teachers, schoolbooks, and the media are principal sources of information and attitudes about foreigners and foreign countries. Americans generally believe that theirs is a superior country, probably the greatest country in the world. It is economically and militarily powerful; its influence extends to all parts of the globe. Americans generally believe their democratic political system is the best possible one, since it gives all citizens the right and opportunity to try to influence government policy and since it protects citizens from arbitrary government actions. They also believe the system is superior because it gives them the freedom to complain about anything they consider wrong with it. Americans generally believe their country’s free-market economic system has enabled them to enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the history of the world.
 * If Americans consider their country to be superior, then it cannot be surprising that they often consider other countries to be inferior. The people in those other countries are assumed to be not quite as intelligent or hardworking or sensible as Americans are.
